Safi Ullah Resume

Welcome to my Resume repository! This repository contains the source code for my online resume, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is built using HTML  and includes information about my education, skills, work experience, and projects. 
You can access the website directly at https://safiullahadam.github.io/Resume/
Feel free to take a look at my resume to know more about myself and code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or send me a message. Thank you for visiting!
